*Squaring the circle is a problem in geometry first proposed in Greek mathematics. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the area of a circle by using only a finite number of steps with a compass and straightedge. In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemannâ€“Weierstrass theorem. Despite the proof that it is impossible, attempts to square the circle have been common in pseudomathematics (i.e., the work of mathematical cranks).* ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle))
